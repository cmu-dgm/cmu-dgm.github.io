            <h2>Usage of GenAI Tools</h2>
            You may <b>not</b> use AI tools for any <b>homework</b>, <b>quizzes</b>, or during the <b>midterm</b>, as this cannot be considered a substitute for developing the fundamental skills and expertise represented by the learning objectives of this course.
            <br><br>
            It is allowed to use generative AI tools in your project development and presentation preparation. However, their use must be appropriately <b>acknowledged and cited</b>. For instance, if you generated a particular paragraph or slide through ChatGPT and edited it for accuracy, your submitted work would need to include a note such as “I generated this part through ChatGPT and edited the content for accuracy.” Paraphrasing or quoting smaller samples of AI generated content must be appropriately acknowledged and cited, following the guidelines established by the <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt">APA Style Guide</a>. It is each student’s responsibility to assess the validity and applicability of any AI output that is submitted. You may not earn full credit if inaccurate on invalid information is found in your work.
            <br><br>
            Deviations from the guidelines above will be considered violations of <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html">CMU’s academic integrity policy</a>.
